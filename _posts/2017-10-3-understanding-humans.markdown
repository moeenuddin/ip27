Ever since the first man came into existence, human's inquisitive nature is the most prominent natural characteristic.
I am interested in <strong>how human learn</strong>.

<strong>Understanding human</strong> is important and core to society. Human life is more valuable than before. and this significance
will keep increasing with time, becuase we as human have undermine human existence in our negligence. This is my attempt to understand human in the simplest possible way. A 
series of articles that can help you build perspective about some things.

<strong>The way we think!</strong>

	I am going to think in terms of outcome. The most practical way to
	realize the reality. The way we think is the core. The way we think is made 
	up of the things we experience and the experiences can lead to stimulate human
	brain to reason out them.


<strong>Human Personality!</strong>

	At current age, you have a personality which is the result of all of the previous
	factors, hidden or known, have contributed in your habits, beliefs and your aura.
	

I will keep updating this document as, it grows.
