I had a chance to make a debut in a competition.

The intent of the solution attempt was to make a good solution. I have tried char based models linear regression and gradient boosting. I scored 0.72 at public which was 5%
test data. The data which was short and have cross-referenced were difficult to check.

I also attempted to produce a psuedo rating based on the validation rules. That's a just a wild attempt i wanted to do.

In any competition, understanding the problem setting, and apllying the right reshaping/clean gives you results. Well, to my experience, cleaning does the makes a difference.

here is the public file: I stood in last 2100 people out of 2300. still a lot to learn.
